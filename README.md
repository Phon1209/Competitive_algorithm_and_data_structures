# Competitive_algorithm_and_data_structures
group of data structures, algorithms and techniques used for competitive programming.

### Contributing Guidelines
- The repository is structured language-wise i.e. algorithms in a certain language go in a specific folder.
- The naming convention to be followed are ```algo_name.language_extention``` , ```ds_name.language_extention``` or ```tech_name.language_extention```.
- The overall path should be
    - ```language/algo/algo_name.language_extention```
    - ```language/ds/ds_name.language_extention```
    - ```language/tech/tech_name.language_extention```
- Example of above points: heap sort in Java should go into `java/algo/heapsort.java`
- It is your choice to include only the function or the entire program for the algorithms or data structures.
- If language that you are looking for aren't exist, create a new one!
